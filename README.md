# Street-Light-external-light-controlled-
- A very simple project using Arduino UNO, where an LED is controlled using analog inputs from a photoresistor.
- Components Used: Arduino UNO (1), LED (1), Photoresisitor (1), Resistors (100 ohms x 2), Connecting Wires, Bread Board.
- for understanding purposes, I took the max volatge required for bulb to glow as 75 mV.
- the whole project was implemented at Tinkercad (https://www.tinkercad.com)
